# Business-Analyst-Internship-Project
The project "Understanding the career aspirations of Gen-Z", which I worked on during my Internship at KultureHire. With rapid technological advancements and shifting market dynamics, it is important to understand how the GEN-Z population is entering the workforce with a unique set of qualities and aspirations and shaping the future of their career.

Under the guidance of Kadhiravan Jayachandiran, I had dive into the Career Aspirations of Gen-z and create a Power BI Dashboard that showcases the key metrics influencing the Gen-Z folks in choosing their career. This visualization also consists of other indicators like preferred Work model, Working Environments, and Career Roles by Gen-Z.

Problem Statement:
As employers and educators, it is essential to understand the career aspirations of Gen Z, who enter the workforce with unique values, expectations, and aspirations. It is crucial for them to understand their career aspirations to effectively support and engage with the emerging talent pool. Our project aimed to shed light on their career aspirations and provide valuable insights through our Power BI dashboard.

Generated Insights:

Self-funded Higher Education: 45% of Gen Z aspires to pursue higher education using their own money. They are determined to take charge of their educational journey and invest in their future.
